        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p> So far, I have made various programs, and I am continuing to make more.
            Here are some of the projects I have worked on:<br>
        <br>
            Calculator in C# and WPF<br>
            This was my first proper program, and I initially followed a tutorial to get started. However , I also added a few features
            myself to give it more funcionality. It helped me solidify the fundamentals of programming, deepen my understanding of 
            logical processes and user interfaces.

        <br>
            String of light in C# and WPF<br>
            After gaining some experience with the calculator project, I wanted to make my own program without following a tutorial from scratch.
            I made a programmable string of light where you can choose a few colors of your own and change the speed of the pattern.
            This enabled me to explore different topics such as timing and dynamic visual effects.

        <br>
            Website in HTML and CSS<br>
            The idea for this website is to showcase my interest in computer science and help me understand web development better.
            I only just started with my journey and wanted to learn other programming languages, so i started following an
            HTML and CSS course on Udemy. I will learn more about website design and make sure that it looks good on various devices.
        <br>

            Future Goals<br>
            One of my major goals is to develop an Android app with a user friendly design and good functionality.
            I want to create an equalizer app because I wasn't able to find a good enough one with the functionality i want.
            This will help me understand mobile development, audio processing and designing a friendly user interface.
