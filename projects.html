        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>So far, I have made various programs, and I am continuing to make more. <br>
            <br>
            Calculator in C# and WPF<br>
            This was my first proper program. It helped me solidify the fundamentals, deepen my understanding of logical processes and user interfaces.
            <br>
            <br>
            String of light in C# and WPF<br>
            For this one, I developed a programmable string of lights that can display various patterns and speeds.
            <br>
            <br>
            Website in HTML and CSS<br>
            The idea for this website is to show my interest in computer science as well as help me understand web development better.
