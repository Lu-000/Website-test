        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> 
            Hello, my name is Luka and I have a passion for Computer science. Since childhood I have been fascinated of computers. 
            I used to help my father in building our own pc. Which helped deepened my interest. <br><br>
            In my free time I enjoy learning new stuff about programming. For example, I have programmed a calculator. 
            Another interest of mine is web development. <br>
            I regularly watch online videos to create and improve my own website. 
            My favorite subject in school is English, which helps me better understand and utilize English resources.
